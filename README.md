**2. Technologies:**

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
- [Dog image API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) (e.g., Dog CEO's Dog API)

**3. Project Structure:**

- Inside the folder, organize your project as follows:
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file.
  - `style.css`: The CSS file for styling.
  - `script.js`: The JavaScript file for interactivity.
  - `images/`: A folder to store project-related images.

**4. HTML Structure:**

- Create the basic HTML structure with appropriate HTML5 semantics.
- Include the following key elements:
  - Header with a title ("PuppyPics") and a search input field.
  - A section to display search results (initially empty).
  - Footer with project information.

**5. CSS Styling:**

- Style the header, search bar, results section, and footer for an attractive and user-friendly design.
- Implement responsive design for various screen sizes.

**6. JavaScript Functionality:**

- Handle user input and interaction.
